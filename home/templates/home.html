            Judie is a performer, director, producer and most importantly a dedicated teacher. Having trained in shakespearean classics in Themes University’s Royal College of Music and Media, Judie has both the experience and a passion for sharing her love of literature with the younger people- balancing enough structure to achieve the aims of the classroom while being fluid enough to meet the students where they are on a given day. Over the past X years , her face has become a familiar one in English classrooms across the country, and by popular demand she has also established a comparatives course for senior cycle and a film studies class for all ages.
            Judie truly is a talented teacher with experience that is second to none. Her understanding of Shakespearean classics, film and overall story structure is invaluable to any student, often leaving an impression that lasts far beyond the classroom
